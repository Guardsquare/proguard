## Java 8 language support

ProGuard can backport Java 8 language features to Dalvik and to older versions
of Java, so you can use them in applications and libraries that work on all
versions of Android.

The following language features are supported:

- lambda expressions (closures)
- method references
- try-with-resources statements
- static interface methods
- default interface methods

Additions to the Java runtime library (like the stream API) can not be
backported without additional runtime dependencies; see the next section.

In order to enable Java 8 language support, a Java 8 Compiler must be
available when running gradle, i.e. by setting `JAVA\_HOME`. You need to
configure the *source* and *target* compatibility settings in your
`build.gradle` script:
```Groovy
android {
    .....
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

If you want to target a minimum API level less than 19, you should add the
following configuration to your `proguard-project.txt`:
```proguard
-target 1.6
```

## Java 8 stream API support

ProGuard can backport the Java 8 stream API to older versions of Android (<
API 24), so you can use it in applications that work on all versions of
Android.

The following additions to Java 8 can be backported and thus be used in an
application:

- classes added in `java.util.function` package
- classes added in `java.util.stream` package
- default and static methods added to interfaces in `java.lang` and
  `java.util` (e.g. Iterable, Collection)
  - static methods added to classes in `java.lang` (Integer, Long, Double) and
  `java.util` (Arrays)
- classes added in `java.util` package (e.g. Optional, StringJoiner)
- classes added/updated in `java.util.concurrent` package (e.g. ForkJoinPool)

The following methods can not be backported and using them will fail the
build:

- methods added to `java.util.Random` (e.g. ints, longs, doubles)
- default method `remove()` in `java.util.Iterator`: classes that rely on a
  default implementation will not work

In order to use the Java 8 stream API and enable backporting in ProGuard, you
have to specify a minimum `compileSdkVersion` of *24*:
```Groovy
android {
    .....
    compileSdkVersion 24 // or a higher version
}
```

Furthermore, you need to add the *streamsupport* library as dependency to your
project, e.g. like this:
```Groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'net.sourceforge.streamsupport:streamsupport:1.6.3'
}
```

If you use the Java 8 stream API in your project, but ProGuard can not
backport to the included *streamsupport* library (e.g. due to an incompatible
version), ProGuard issues warnings in the console log.

Note: ProGuard currently only supports the core streamsupport library.
Additional modules (cfuture, atomic, flow, literal) are not yet backported.
Please contact [Guardsquare](https://www.guardsquare.com/) if you want to use
them as well.

## Java 8 time API support (JSR310)

ProGuard can backport the **Java 8 time API** to older versions of Android
(< API 26), so you can use it in applications that work on all versions of
Android.

The following additions to Java 8 can be backported and thus be used in an
application:

- classes added in `java.time` package

The *java.time* API includes various interfaces with default / static methods.
ProGuard can backport the use of these methods can be backported, but in case
you implement these interfaces yourself (which would be unusual), the
resulting class can not be fully backported (due to missing default methods).
This includes the following interfaces:

- java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate
- java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime
- java.time.chrono.Chronology
- java.time.chrono.ChronoPeriod
- java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime
- java.time.chrono.Era
- java.time.temporal.Temporal
- java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor
- java.time.temporal.TemporalField
- java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit

In order to use the Java 8 time API and enable backporting in ProGuard,
a minimum `compileSdkVersion` of *26* has to be used:
```Groovy
android {
    .....
    compileSdkVersion 26 // or a higher version
}
```

Furthermore, you need to add the *threetenbp* library as dependency to your
project, e.g. like this:
```Groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    ...
    api group: 'org.threeten', name: 'threetenbp', version: '1.3.6'
}
```

It is highly recommended to use the *threetenabp* library from Jake Wharton
instead, which is just as a wrapper around the *threetenbp* library and
provides an efficient way to initialize the timezone database:
```Groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.0.5'
}
```

Additionally, you have to initialize the timezone database in your application
class like this:
```java
public void onCreate()
{
    super.onCreate();
    ...
    com.jakewharton.threetenabp.AndroidThreeTen.init(this);
}
```

If you use the Java 8 stream API in your project, but ProGuard can not
backport to the included *threetenbp* library (e.g. due to an incompatible
version), ProGuard issues warnings in the console log.
