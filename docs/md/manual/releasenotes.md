## Version 7.1 (June 2021)

### AGP 7 compatible Gradle plugin

The way ProGuard is integrated into Android projects is changing because AGP 7 will no longer allow developers to disable R8 with the `android.enableR8` Gradle property.

ProGuard 7.1 includes a new Gradle plugin which allows for a seamless integration with this new AGP version. A detailed and step-by-step guide for transition from the previous plugin is provided in the [upgrading guide](setup/upgrading.md).

- Simple integration with Android Gradle Projects by adding a dependency on the
[ProGuard Gradle Plugin artifact](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.guardsquare/proguard-gradle/7.1.0) and applying the `com.guardsquare.proguard` plugin, as presented in the [Gradle plugin setup instructions](setup/gradleplugin.md).

### Java support

New Java versions are released every 6 months. 
To allow ProGuard to continue to optimize, obfuscate and shrink Java class files we have added support for the latest releases, up to Java 16.
This includes 

- Add support for processing Java 14, 15 and 16 class files. (`PGC-0015`, `PGD-0064`)
- Add support for Java 14 sealed classes. (`PGD-0064`)
- Add support for records (previewed in Java 15/16, targeted for Java 17). (`PGD-0064`)

### New optimizations

ProGuard 7.1 adds 5 new code [optimizations](configuration/optimizations.md). 
These optimization aim at reducing the number of classes required by the application and help pinpointing the specialized type wherever possible. This can have a positive impact on code shrinking and application performances. 

 - `method/specialization/returntype` - specializes the types of method return values, whenever possible.
 - `method/specialization/parametertype` - specializes the types of method parameters, whenever possible.
 - `method/generalization/class` - generalizes the classes of method invocations, whenever possible.
 - `field/specialization/type` - specializes the types of fields, whenever possible.
 - `field/generalization/class` - generalizes the classes of field accesses, whenever possible.

### Maven central

ProGuard was previously hosted at JCenter, but this repository has recently been removed. 
ProGuard is now published to [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.guardsquare/proguard-gradle/7.1.0).

 - Simple integration : follow the [Gradle plugin setup instructions](setup/gradleplugin.md) to select the `mavenCentral()` repository and dependencies to the `proguard-gradle` artifact.

### Easier configuration

The [`-addconfigurationdebugging`](configuration/usage.md#addconfigurationdebugging) allows to help configuring ProGuard `-keep` rules. 
For more details and to see this in action have a look at [Configuring ProGuard, an Easy Step-by-Step Tutorial](https://www.guardsquare.com/blog/configuring-proguard-an-easy-step-by-step-tutorial).

`-addconfigurationdebugging` previously reported `-keep` rule suggestions for classes, methods or fields that did not exist in the app. Such `-keep` rules are not necessary.

ProGuard 7.1 improves the suggestion of `-keep` rules by only suggesting rules for classes, methods and fields that were actually in the original application (`DGD-3264`).

- More precise keep rule suggestions provided by `-addconfigurationdebugging`. 
- Easier ProGuard -keep rules configuration.
- Reduced ProGuard configuration size.

### Miscellaneous

#### Improvements

 - Remove Gradle plugin dependency on Android build tools. (`PGD-0066`)
 - Improve error message when missing classes result in an incomplete class hierarchy. (`DGD-0013`)
 - Improve speed of horizontal class merging. (`DGD-1471`)
 - Fix potential `NullPointerException` during GSON optimization. (`T3568`, `T3607`)
 - Fix potential dangling switch labels and next local index in `GsonDeserializationOptimizer`.
 - Fix potential `NoClassDefFoundError` at runtime after applying Gson optimization to library project. (`T2374`)
 - Improve general performance and stability of optimization.
 
#### Bug fixes

 - Fix `ProGuardTask` Gradle task compatibility with Gradle 7. (`PGD-0136`)
 - Fix potentially incorrect class merging optimizations that could cause a run-time `NullPointerException`. (`DGD-3377`)
 - Fix Gradle task error when using an existing `-outjar` directory. (`PGD-0106`)
