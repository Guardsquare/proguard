By now, we've invested an enormous amount of time in **ProGuard**. You can
help by providing feedback! If you have problems, bugs, bug fixes, ideas,
encouragements, etc., please let us know.

At [Guardsquare](http://www.guardsquare.com/), we develop ProGuard and its
professional siblings DexGuard (for Android) and iXGuard (for iOS). If you
find ProGuard useful and you are interested in more features or professional
support, this is the place to go.

ProGuard is currently hosted on GitHub:

- You can report issues on our
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/issues).

- You can clone the
  [source code](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard) yourself and create
  [pull requests](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/pulls).
