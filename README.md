ProGuard is a free shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier for Java
bytecode:

* It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes.

* It optimizes bytecode and removes unused instructions.

* It renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short
  meaningless names.

The resulting applications and libraries are smaller, faster, and a bit better
hardened against reverse engineering. ProGuard is very popular for Android
development, but it also works for Java code in general.

## ‚ùì Getting Help
If you have **usage or general questions** please ask them in the <a href="https://community.guardsquare.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=site-link&utm_campaign=github-community">**Guardsquare Community**.</a>  
Please use <a href="https://github.com/guardsquare/proguard/issues">**the issue tracker**</a> to report actual **bugs üêõ, crashes**, etc.

## üöÄ Quick Start

ProGuard has its own Gradle plugin, allowing you to shrink, optimize and obfuscate Android projects. 

### ProGuard Gradle Plugin

You can apply the ProGuard Gradle plugin in AGP 4+ projects by following these steps:

1. Add a `classpath` dependency in your root level `build.gradle` file:

```Groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()       // For the Android Gradle plugin.
        mavenCentral() // For the ProGuard Gradle Plugin and anything else.
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:x.y.z'    // The Android Gradle plugin.
        classpath 'com.guardsquare:proguard-gradle:7.2.1'  // The ProGuard Gradle plugin.
    }
}
```

2. Apply the `proguard` plugin after applying the Android Gradle plugin as shown below:

```Groovy
 apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
 apply plugin: 'com.guardsquare.proguard'
```

3. ProGuard expects unobfuscated class files as input. Therefore, other obfuscators such as R8 have to be disabled.

```Groovy
android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
       release {
          // Deactivate R8.
          minifyEnabled false
       }
    }
}
```

4. Configure variants to be processed with ProGuard using the `proguard` block:

```Groovy
android {
    ...
}

proguard {
   configurations {
      release {
         defaultConfiguration 'proguard-android-optimize.txt'
         configuration 'proguard-project.txt'
      }
   }
}
```

You can then build your application as usual:

```shell
gradle assembleRelease
```

The repository contains some sample configurations in the [examples](examples)
directory. Notably, [examples/android](examples/android-plugin) has a small working
Android project that applies the ProGuard Gradle plugin.

### Integrated ProGuard (AGP < 7.0)

If you have an older Android Gradle project you can enable ProGuard instead of the default R8 compiler:

1. Disable R8 in your `gradle.properties`:

```gradle
android.enableR8=false
android.enableR8.libraries=false
```

2. Override the default version of ProGuard with the most recent one in your
   main `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    //...
    configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy {
            dependencySubstitution {
                substitute module('net.sf.proguard:proguard-gradle') with module('com.guardsquare:proguard-gradle:7.2.1')
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. Enable minification as usual in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    //...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled   true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFile getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt')
            proguardFile 'proguard-project.txt'
        }
    }
}
```

4. Add any necessary configuration to your `proguard-project.txt`.

You can then build your application as usual:

```shell
gradle assembleRelease
```

The repository contains some sample configurations in the [examples](examples)
directory. Notably, [examples/android-agp3-agp4](examples/android-agp3-agp4) has a small working
Android project that uses the old integration.

## ‚ú® Features

ProGuard works like an advanced optimizing compiler, removing unused classes,
fields, methods, and attributes, shortening identifiers, merging classes,
inlining methods, propagating constants, removing unused parameters, etc.

* The optimizations typically reduce the size of an application by anything
  between 20% and 90%. The reduction mostly depends on the size of external
  libraries that ProGuard can remove in whole or in part.

* The optimizations may also improve the performance of the application, by up
  to 20%. For Java virtual machines on servers and desktops, the difference
  generally isn't noticeable. For the Dalvik virtual machine and ART on
  Android devices, the difference can be worth it.

* ProGuard can also remove logging code, from applications and their
  libraries, without needing to change the source code &mdash; in fact,
  without needing the source code at all!

The manual pages ([markdown](docs/md),
[html](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard/manual)) cover the features and usage of
ProGuard in detail.

## üíª Building ProGuard

Building ProGuard is easy - you'll just need a Java 8 JDK installed. 
To build from source, clone a copy of the ProGuard repository and run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

The artifacts will be generated in the `lib` directory. You can then execute ProGuard using the
scripts in `bin`, for example:

```bash
bin/proguard.sh
```

You can publish the artifacts to your local Maven repository using:

```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
