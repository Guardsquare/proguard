# This ProGuard configuration file illustrates how to process a program
# library, such that it remains usable as a library.
# Usage:
#     java -jar proguard.jar @library.pro
#

-verbose

# Specify the input jars, output jars, and library jars.
# In this case, the input jar is the program library that we want to process.

-injars  in.jar
-outjars out.jar

# Before Java 9, the runtime classes were packaged in a single jar file.
#-libraryjars <java.home>/lib/rt.jar

# As of Java 9, the runtime classes are packaged in modular jmod files.
-libraryjars <java.home>/jmods/java.base.jmod(!**.jar;!module-info.class)
#-libraryjars <java.home>/jmods/.....

# Save the obfuscation mapping to a file, so we can de-obfuscate any stack
# traces later on. Keep a fixed source file attribute and all line number
# tables to get line numbers in the stack traces.
# You can comment this out if you're not interested in stack traces.

# Preserve all public classes, and their public and protected fields and

# classes.

# Explicitly preserve all serialization members. The Serializable interface
# is only a marker interface, so it wouldn't save them.
# You can comment this out if your library doesn't use serialization.
# If your code contains serializable classes that have to be backward
# compatible, please refer to the manual.

# Your library may contain more items that need to be preserved;
# typically classes that are dynamically created using Class.forName:

# -keep public class com.example.MyClass
# -keep public interface com.example.MyInterface
# -keep public class * implements com.example.MyInterface
